## The Practice

1. **Pick ONE feed** - start with Quanta or arXiv astro-ph
2. **Read until something hooks you** - don't force it
3. **Ask: can I visualize this?**
4. **Build it** - even badly at first
5. **The building reveals what you don't understand**
6. **Go deeper into papers** to fill gaps

## Project Ideas from Real Data

| Source | Visualization |
|--------|--------------|
| NASA Exoplanet Archive | Real solar systems in Three.js |
| USGS Earthquake API | Live 3D globe with quakes |
| NOAA Ocean Data | Temperature/current flows |
| Protein Data Bank | 3D molecule structures |
| LIGO Gravitational Waves | Spacetime ripple animations |
| NASA NEO API | Near-Earth asteroid tracker |

## The Deep Reading Path

When a visualization interests you, trace back:
1. News article → 2. Original paper (usually linked) → 3. Papers it cites → 4. Textbook for fundamentals

Don't feel bad about not understanding papers. Nobody does at first.
The goal isn't comprehension. It's **reducing confusion incrementally**.
